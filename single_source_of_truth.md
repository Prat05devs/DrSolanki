Robotic & Laparoscopic Surgery
Advanced ‘keyhole’ surgeries done through very small cuts instead of large incisions.
•⁠  ⁠Laparoscopic surgery uses a camera and fine instruments guided by the surgeon’s hands.
•⁠  ⁠Robotic surgery uses robotic arms controlled by the surgeon for greater precision.
•⁠  ⁠Less pain after surgery
•⁠  ⁠Minimal scarring
•⁠  ⁠Faster recovery and earlier return to normal life
•⁠  ⁠Lower risk of complications compared to open surgery

Reproductive Medicine & Surgery
Identifies the root cause of reproductive problems and offers personalised medical or surgical solutions to improve fertility and overall reproductive health. Reproductive medicine through IVF-ART (In Vitro Fertilisation-Assisted Reproductive Technology) procedures addresses hormonal health, ovulation, fertility, and reproductive organs, while surgery addresses structural problems in conditions like 
•⁠  ⁠Irregular periods
•⁠  ⁠PCOS
•⁠  ⁠Endometriosis
•⁠  ⁠Fibroids
•⁠  ⁠Blocked fallopian tubes
•⁠  ⁠Unexplained infertility

Fertility Preservation & Fertility Enhancement Surgery
Women with a desire to experience motherhood, this care helps women protect or improve their ability to conceive, now or in the future.Fertility preservation may be considered if:
•⁠  ⁠Pregnancy is planned later in life
•⁠  ⁠Cancer treatment or surgery may affect fertility
•⁠  ⁠There is reduced ovarian reserve
Fertility enhancement surgery may help when:
•⁠  ⁠Fibroids distort the uterus
•⁠  ⁠Endometriosis affects fertility
•⁠  ⁠Uterine abnormalities

These options give women choice, control, and reassurance, allowing them to plan motherhood without compromising health or timing.

Aesthetic & Cosmetic Gynaecology
Addresses functional discomfort as well as emotional well-being, not just appearance.
Women experiencing:
•⁠  ⁠Vaginal laxity – a feeling of looseness after childbirth or with ageing
•⁠  ⁠Labiaplasty concerns – discomfort, irritation, or self-consciousness due to enlarged or asymmetrical labia
•⁠  ⁠Dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) – affecting intimacy and quality of life
These concerns are real and common, and treatment is about restoring comfort, confidence, and sexual well-being, not cosmetic perfection.

Uro-Gynaecology
Uro-gynaecology focuses on bladder, bowel, and pelvic floor problems that many women silently endure.
Common issues include:
•⁠  ⁠Urine leakage during coughing or exercise
•⁠  ⁠Frequent or urgent urination
•⁠  ⁠Pelvic organ prolapse (feeling of something “coming down”)
•⁠  ⁠Difficulty emptying the bladder
These conditions can affect daily activities, social confidence, sleep, and dignity. Early evaluation allows effective treatment often without major surgery.

FAQs

Laparoscopic Hysterectomy

Faster Recovery. Less Pain. More Confidence.

For many women, the word hysterectomy brings worry 
Will it be painful? Will I be in the hospital for many days? How long will recovery take?

These concerns are completely natural. The good news is, surgery has evolved.

With modern laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery and a carefully planned recovery program, hysterectomy today can be much safer, gentler, and faster to recover from.

If you are considering hysterectomy and have fears or questions, know that you are not alone- and modern, gentle options are available.


What Is Laparoscopic Hysterectomy?

Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a minimally invasive surgery done through very small incisions.
Compared to open surgery, it usually means:
•⁠  ⁠Less pain
•⁠  ⁠Smaller scars
•⁠  ⁠Faster healing
•⁠  ⁠Quicker return to normal life

Faster Healing with Enhanced Recovery (ERAS)

Dr Smit Bharat Solanki routinely follow a modern approach called Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS).

What does that mean for you?

Instead of:
•⁠  ⁠Long hours of fasting
•⁠  ⁠Strong pain injections
•⁠  ⁠Staying in bed for days

We focus on:
•⁠  ⁠Better pain control
•⁠  ⁠Early walking
•⁠  ⁠Early eating
•⁠  ⁠Short and safe hospital stay

The goal is simple: help your body recover naturally and faster - without increasing risk.


Is This Approach Safe and Proven?

Yes.

Dr Smit Bharat Solanki published a medical study involving 56 women who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy under care across different hospitals.

The results were reassuring:
•⁠  ⁠All patients walked within 6 hours
•⁠  ⁠All started eating within 6 hours
•⁠  ⁠All went home within 24 hours
-  complications were observed


How Is Dr Smit Bharat Solanki’s Approach Different?
•⁠  ⁠Minimal use of strong pain medicines
•⁠  ⁠Encouragement of early movement
•⁠  ⁠Early, comfortable feeding
•⁠  ⁠Short hospital stay-only when it is safe

Every patient is discharged only when she is comfortable, walking, eating, and medically stable.

Is Early Discharge Really Safe?

Yes.
You are never rushed home.

Discharge happens only after careful medical evaluation, and you are given clear guidance and support for recovery at home.


Who Can Benefit from This Approach?

Women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy for:
	•	Fibroids
	•	Heavy or irregular bleeding
	•	Adenomyosis
	•	Chronic pelvic pain
